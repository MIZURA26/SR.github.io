     <h2 style="font-family:'segoe script';"> What is Badminton? </h2>
     <p>
      Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of
      the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard
      or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the
      other team's half of the court.

     <h2 style="font-family:'segoe script';"> How to serve </h2>
     <p> When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver
      must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand
      wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver. </p>
      <p> At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts. The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in
       the receiver's service court. This is similar to tennis, except that in a badminton serve the whole shuttle must be below 1.15 metres from the surface of the
       court at the instant of being hit by the server's racket, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service
       courts, unlike tennis. </p>
